This project involves a Pixl.js board with a NB-IoT-Explorer board, complete with an EMnify global IoT sim card.

This code only runs on a Pixl.js board, which can be programmed though the web IDE at https://www.espruino.com/ide/

The purpose of this code is to test the availability of CAT-M cellular connectivity technology. The device will scan for all available carriers and connection types, testing the connection to each one.
